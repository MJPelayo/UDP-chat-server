# GoChat - A UDP/TCP Chat Application

GoChat is a high-performance, command-line chat application built in Go that supports both UDP and TCP protocols. It features a robust server-client architecture with advanced functionality including private messaging, admin controls, and performance benchmarking.

## Features

### üöÄ Core Features
- Multi-client support via UDP with TCP benchmarking
- Admin privileges system (username "admin")
- Interactive help menu with command auto-completion
- Color-coded messages for better readability
- Typing indicators for active users

- Username changing (`/rename` command)
- Admin menu for privileged users
- Connection status indicators
- Clean, colorized interface

### üìä Benchmarking
- UDP performance testing
- TCP performance comparison
- Message rate calculation
- Latency measurement per message
